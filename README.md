# final-project

## feelings towards finals week
So far finals week is pretty calm. To be perfectly honest, I thought this test would be a lot short than it actually was. Otherwise, I stil have accounting, system security, PLP, and my practicum class remaining. I take back the calm part. Writing this all out is starting to stress me out.
